The orange curve represents Hispanic patients (the “treated” group), while the blue curve represents White, non-Hispanic patients (the control group). Where the two curves sit on the horizontal axis tells you how similar the groups look on the covariates we used to build the score: a value near 0 means a patient’s profile makes them very unlikely to be Hispanic; a value near 0.10 means their profile is fairly typical of Hispanics in the data. The key takeaway is the overlap region between roughly 0.03 and 0.09 where both curves sit on top of each other—this is the “common support” zone. Because every treated patient in that band has control patients with almost identical propensity scores, we can form well-balanced matched pairs and make credible causal comparisons. Overall, the plot reassures us that matching is feasible and that the final effect we estimate will be based on patients who are genuinely comparable on age, stage, and sex—isolating ethnicity as the key difference."

Although the Hispanic mean is three months higher, both groups exhibit wide dispersion (standard deviations ≈ 40–42 months), meaning individual experiences vary greatly around these averages. Given the relatively small number of Hispanic cases (33 versus 708 White non-Hispanic), this raw difference could easily be driven by chance or by other factors—such as age or stage at diagnosis—rather than by ethnicity itself. In other words, the summary suggests no obvious survival disadvantage for Hispanic patients, but the overlap in variability and the imbalance in sample sizes signal that we need formal statistical tests or covariate-adjusted analyses before drawing any causal conclusions."

First, power is limited: with only 33 Hispanic observations the test has little chance of detecting anything but a very large effect, and expected counts flirt with the rule-of-thumb minimum of five (a Fisher exact test reaches the same “no evidence” conclusion). Second, the comparison is unadjusted: it ignores the fact that our Hispanic and White patients differ in age and stage distribution. The propensity-score overlap we plotted confirms that there are sufficient control patients to build balanced matched pairs, and our logistic-regression model already adjusts survival odds for age, stage, and sex. Those covariate-balanced analyses are therefore crucial to determine whether an underlying disparity emerges once patients are made comparable on their clinical profiles."

    "> Once DAME produced exact matches on age band, stage, and sex, we effectively re-balanced the covariate distributions between Hispanics (treated = 1) and White, non-Hispanics (treated = 0). Running the logistic model again on this matched sample is a quick robustness check on i f matching truly balanced the covariates, the treated coefficient in the regression should move even closer to zero and lose any residual significance, because all systematic differences have been purged. and the other covariate coefficients may shrink or lose significance as well, because within matched strata there is less variation left for the model to explain.\n",

    "> First, the ethnicity term is essentially null: the log-odds coefficient for treated is +0.053 (p = 0.90), which translates to an odds-ratio of roughly 1.05—virtually no difference in five-year survival between Hispanic patients and their matched White, non-Hispanic counterparts. Age remains the dominant prognostic factor: each successive age-band dummy carries a larger negative coefficient, confirming that the probability of surviving five years falls steadily as patients move from the 40-49 band into older decades, even after coarse age matching. Stage effects largely disappear once matching has enforced exact agreement on stage; the coefficients for Stage II and Stage III are small and statistically insignificant because little residual variation in stage is left for the model to explain. Finally, sex retains a large standard error and remains non-significant, reflecting the very small number of males in the cohort. Together, these coefficients reinforce the matching and ATT findings: once patients are aligned on stage, age, and sex, Hispanic ethnicity itself does not meaningfully alter five-year overall survival."

    "> After coarse exact matching on age band, AJCC stage, and sex, every Hispanic patient was paired with a clinically identical White, non-Hispanic control (621 total matched units).  The matching produced an average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of +2.8 percentage-points, meaning Hispanic patients were 2.8 pp more likely to survive five years than their matched controls.  A follow-up logistic regression on this balanced set confirmed the absence of any statistically meaningful ethnicity effect (β = 0.053, p = 0.90; odds-ratio ≈ 1.05).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Taken together, these results indicate that—conditional on presenting at the same stage, age band, and sex—Hispanic ethnicity does not reduce five-year overall survival.  The slight positive ATT is well within the wide confidence band implied by the small treated sample and mirrors the regression estimate’s 95 % CI, which comfortably spans unity.  In short, once clinical factors are aligned, survival outcomes for Hispanic and White, non-Hispanic breast-cancer patients in this cohort are essentially indistinguishable."
